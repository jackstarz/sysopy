Pomiary pokazuja, ze przy mniejszych rozmiarach rekordow, uzywajac funkcji bibliotecznych zarowno kopiowanie jak
i sortowanie rekordow odbywa sie w krotszym czasie, niz funkcji za pomoca systemowych.
Odwrotnie jest przy wiekszych rekordach (powyzej 512kB), gdzie szybsze staja sie funkcje systemowe.
